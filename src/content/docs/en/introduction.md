## Name
Uchibori

## Degree
Master (M.A.)

## Major
### Anthropology, Ethnology
The region is Oceania including Palau. Recently, I am also interested in Okinawa.
### Linguistics
I prefer descriptive grammar and comparative linguistics to generative grammar.
### Meaning Form Theory  
I am researching the grammatical theory of one of the world's greatest linguists born in Japan, Tsugio Sekiguchi. I am currently carrying out the following website.

### Languages
　I am certified in English (English Proficiency Test Level 1), Chinese (Chinese Language Proficiency Test Level 2), and Korean (Korean Language Proficiency Test Level 3). As a linguist, I should really be studying French, German, ancient Greek and Latin if I have time, Russian if I have more time, and as an Austronesian language researcher, Indonesian or Tagalog, but I am halfway through all of them. Right now I am studying Okinawan. I would like to create a site dedicated to the language someday, but it has not materialized because I update it too infrequently.
### Photo
I am in the process of changing from Canon EOS Kiss (film camera) to Canon EOS Kiss 3 (APS-C digital camera) to Nikon D610 (full size digital camera). Recently, I am interested in SONY, but I don't have enough lens assets...
### Collecting autographed books
I used to buy and receive autographs often. I used to buy and receive autographs from a wide range of genres, from Hisanosuke Izui to Kyuyo Ishikawa, Kanako Nishi, and Kikuko Tsumura.
