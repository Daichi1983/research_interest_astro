Linguistics is the study of what it means to be human through language. So far, only humans are able to control language. Although plants and animals communicate in a variety of ways, it was believed that only humans are able to live collectively with complex verbal communication (recently, research has shown that even birds speak language).

The founder of modern linguistics is said to be Ferdinan De Saussure. Saussure divided language into the following three categories

- Langue
- Parole
- Language

He then defined Langue as the subject of linguistics.

The main fields of linguistics are comparative linguistics, contrastive linguistics, descriptive linguistics, phonetics, phonology, semantics, and generative grammar. The developmental origins of language have not been discussed much since 1866, when the Paris Philological Society banned debate on the origins of language, deeming it an unanswerable question, but the traditional trend is being revisited, with Tomasello and others making such arguments in primatology and linguistics.

## Introduction to Linguistics

The lecture notes in which Saussure states that the object of study in linguistics should be Langue are indispensable. However, the lecture notes are also difficult to read. The best way to understand Saussure's thought is to read the commentaries that serve as a guide.

### Comparative Linguistics

This is a well-known classic book. Hisanosuke Izumii, a translator and professor at Kyoto University, bought four of this book, ruined three of them, and had a fourth copy by his bedside as he was dying.
