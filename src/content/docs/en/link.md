- [STUDIA HUMANITATIS](http://studiahumanitatis.g1.xrea.com/) (only in Japanese)  
I am overwhelmed by the amount of reading and the vast knowledge on this site. One day, I would like to review specialized humanities and social science books and language books with the same great language skills and knowledge as the owner of this site.
- [西洋哲学資料館](https://tetsugaku.tripod.com/) (only in Japanese)  
A website dealing with Western philosophy. The list of philosophers and the introduction to philosophy are worth reading.
