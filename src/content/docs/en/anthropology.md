Cultural anthropology, also known as ethnology, is the study of what it means to be a person through the activities of people's lives. So far, only humans have what is called culture (although some primates are said to have something like culture). It is precisely because humans have culture that they have been able to expand their habitat from the equator to the polar regions.  

It is said that the major turning point in cultural anthropology was due to the following two books.

These two books were the first ethnographies (research reports depicting people's lives) based on fieldwork (research in the field), because they were the first ethnographies based on fieldwork (research in the field). Both were originally published in 1922. From this time on, the method of participatory observation, in which one enters the other's society and observes while living there oneself, was established.

Cultural anthropology is divided into various fields such as social anthropology, economic anthropology, ecological anthropology, psychological anthropology, cognitive anthropology, symbolic anthropology, medical anthropology, and development anthropology.

Japan has traditionally been strong in Southeast Asian studies, but it should be noted that despite its geographical remoteness, the study of Africa is also thriving. In anthropology, societies where people live in simple ways are more convenient for studying the relevant factors, so there is a tendency to go to people who live simple lives rather than to those who live in urban areas, where various factors (variables) are involved. (This has not always been the case in recent years.)

So some go to Africa, some to the far north, some to Oceania. I went to Oceania, but recent trends indicate that there are not many more Oceania researchers.
