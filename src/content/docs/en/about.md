## How the website was established
As you can see in the [introduction](./introduction), the owner of this site has created various websites. In the old days, I rented a homepage space on Geocities (before it was moved to Yahoo! Japan) ), typed HTML by hand, scanned in my own photos, and uploaded the files via FFFTP. Including blogs, I have probably created about 20 sites. Most of them were created using free services, so they are now in danger of disappearing. Otherwise, they would have been lost in the sea of the Internet. At the time, I had no idea that Geocities, which was flying by the seat of its pants, would disappear.

I have loved languages since I was a high school student, and I happend to come across Tsugio Sekiguchi and linguistics in my University days. I have reached such an age that my life deadline has come just to carefully read the writings of Tsugio Sekiguchi, and my life deadline has come just to grasp the whole picture of the comparative linguistics of Austronesian languages. I have managed to compile my [book reviews](https://biblevi.net/), [travelogues and photos](https://webkikou.net/), and [translations of Chinese revolutionary songs](https://chinesesong.blog.jp/), which I have been writing in an irresponsible manner, and I am now working on a special site for each of them. I had to create a special site for each of them so that they could be viewed as a whole, or else they would be scattered all over the place.

### About Palau

There is a wide range of information about Palau on the Internet, and if you look for it, you will find it. However, if you do not know about Palau, you will not be able to find it. For example, the Palauan diet is conscious of Odoim (staple food), which is mainly starch, and Ongraol (side dishes), which is mainly protein, as described in [Senri Ethnological Report (SER) 1980, Vol. 5, No. 2](http://test-minpaku.com/research/activity/publication/periodical/bulletin/05_2), but it is very difficult to find it if you do not know it. In addition, although recently, with the development of the Internet, it has become possible to see photos and videos of Sonsorol and Tobi, the southwestern islands of Palau, an overview of their language is still not available in Capell, Arthur. Grammar and vocabulary of the language of Washington: Pacific Science Office, National Research Council, 1951.

We would like to make this website a place where we can write and accumulate small articles like this.

## Technical Explanation
This page was created using [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/), a static site generator (SSG). At first, I was using Gatsby and Next.js, but I decided to use Astro because it is more ideal for page structure and it is also more scalable.

However, my main goal was to learn more about other technologies. Although I said I wanted to learn, Astro is very easy to use, and I can create pages without using TypeScript, and I can write pages with markdown without knowing HTML/CSS to some extent. Since the pages are not updated very often anyway, it is better to make it this easy so that the technology is not forgotten (or easily remembered). I really wish I could do more with the title logo or layout that I like, but I don't have that much enthusiasm for it at the moment.

I've written too many unnecessary things when what is important in a website is the content. From now on, I would like to enhance the main content.
